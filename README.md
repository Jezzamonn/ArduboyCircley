# ArduboyCircley
An Arduboy graphics demo that makes a cool circle-like pattern.

To run it on the Arduboy, just download the files, open the .ino file and install it on your Arduboy.

**Important:** This thing starts flashing like crazy after a while, so be careful if you're succeptible to seizures.
